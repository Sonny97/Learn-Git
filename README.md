## Workflow :memo:

Our general DEV workflow should be the next:

1 - Find a task that has a score and you feel confortable developing.
2 - Make sure all the info you need to develop it is available to you, if not ask the team.
3 - assign the task to yourself and set it on the "To do" or "Doing" columns depending on when you will actually start.
4 - create a new branch from the 'develop' branch named this way:
        'feature/description' for additions
        'bugfix/description' for bugfixes
        'enhancement/description' for improvements
        'issue/description'
5 - code :D
6 - commit your changes.
7 - if your task is ready submit a pull request on Github.

**Pull request should always:**
- Have pictures or screenshots if it has visuals in it.
- Have a link to the trello task related to it.

**Notes:**
- All PRs should be named like their branch
**- All code should be properly documented, refer to the documentation and comments sections of the style guides.**
- all PRs need at-least 2 approvals from the team to be merged to develop.
- Your submissions should have commits that are clear and have intent, don't  add a commit if it is not needed, but avoid vague commits.
- If you feel your code needs more than one commit to keep it clear and organized, please do it.
- If someone ask questions on your PR, that doesn't mean they think you are wrong or are attacking you.
- Ask ALL the questions you need through out the process, the team is here for you.
